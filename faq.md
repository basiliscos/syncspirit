## How to import existing directories into shared folder, i.e. to avoid  full
synchronization and transfer over network?

The [BEP-protocol](https://docs.syncthing.net/specs/bep-v1.html) tracks the
following information on a synchinized file:

1. Content, i.e. data blocks,

2. File metainformation, i.e. permissions and modification times

3. Syncrhonization information, i.e. file modification history from cluster point
of view.


Hence, simple file copying into the destination directory (1) is not enough.
Copying files full metainformation (i.e. (1) and (2)), can be done via the
following steps (on linux and mac-os):

- Create an archive with preserved permissions via (`p` is essential here):

```
tar -cjpf folder.tar.bz2 folder
```

- Unpack in the target location via

```
tar -xpf folder.tar.bz2
```

However, the synchronization information cannot be obtained outside of `syncspririt`,
to get it the following steps should be done:

1. Share folder with a peer, set the `scheduled` checkmark on the folder.

2. Wait until metainformation is fetched from a peer

3. Unpack the folder into the destination directory (`tar -xpf ...`)

4. Do "scan" on the folder.

You are not forced to import the whole folder. That way partial per-directory
import is also supported. The only requirement is tha the unpacked directories
should be located in the proper places.
